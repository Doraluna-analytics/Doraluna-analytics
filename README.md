### Hi there 👋

I am recent graduate from Data Analytics at Turing College.
Studies formed practical knowledge of data analysis, problem-solving, and strategic thinking.
I would like to make a meaningful impact in a role that values innovation, design thinking and is data-driven. 

I enjoy working with projects that foster collaboration and encourage innovation, to mention a few:
The Magic Book MVP built with Arduino as unique tool for programming education,
Contemporary interpretation of Classical poem “The Seasons”,
Big data visualisation in the form of “Seaborn” mobile application,
UI/UX standard for Telia Business Intelligence analytical dashboards
and more.

During creative process I tend not only to offer high quality solutions, but I also manage processes from idea to realisation/implementation whether it is individual or team work. I think that understanding design and data is good combination to be able to critically evaluate, interpret and solve real-world problems from unique angle.
