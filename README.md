### Intro
I would like to make a meaningful impact in a role that values innovation, design thinking and is data-driven.

I think that understanding design and data is good combination to be able to critically evaluate, interpret and solve real-world problems from unique angle.

### Technologies and Tools I use:
Spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, Python, Figma, Adobe Creative Suite.
