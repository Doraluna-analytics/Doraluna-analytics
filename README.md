### Hi there 👋

![Best_Data_Analytics_Tools_-_article_image](https://github.com/Doraluna-analytics/Doraluna-analytics/assets/143210222/d74220ec-d8c1-4e98-ad9d-35ae5e24b873)

### Currently
I am recent graduate from Data Analytics at Turing College.
I would like to make a meaningful impact in a role that values innovation, design thinking and is data-driven. 
During creative process I tend not only to offer high quality solutions, but I also manage processes from idea to realisation/implementation whether it is individual or team work. I think that understanding design and data is good combination to be able to critically evaluate, interpret and solve real-world problems from unique angle.

### Technologies and Tools I use:
Spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, Python, Figma.
